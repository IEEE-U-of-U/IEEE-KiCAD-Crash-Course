# IEEE KiCAD Crash Course Fall 2025

## Introduction
Welcome to the IEEE KiCAD Crash Course for Fall 2025 at the University of Utah!

## General Information

We will be hosting this workshop over 4 weeks this semester, currently scheduled for **Tuesdays at 4:00 PM to 5:30 PM** beginning September 30th and ending Oct 28th (see tentative schedule below). The intended groups are any interested student organizations at the University of Utah such as USR, UCubeSat, and FSAE.

The workshops will be held in **WEB 2470** unless otherwise specified.

We will be presenting a design for a *USB-C Breadboard Power Supply* and all participants are invited to participate in designing their own PCBs.

__Workshop Goals__

- Introduction to PCB design
- Introduction to ECAD software (KiCAD)
- Introduction to Schematic Layout
- Introduction to PCB Layout

## ECAD Software

### KiCAD

Please install KiCAD if you are not using Altium. While we do support this program, as KiCAD can import Altium files, we will be focusing on Altium Designer.
